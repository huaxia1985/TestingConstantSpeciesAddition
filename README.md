# TestingConstantSpeciesAddition
R codes to generate null models and testing model adequacy in phylogenetic analyses of temporal patterns in species addition
See details in paper "Modelling colonization rates over time: generating null models and testing model adequacy in phylogenetic analyses of species assemblages" by Xia Hua and Lindell Bromham
"code for colonization timing" is the executable code to generate Figure 2 in the paper.
"code for tip branch length" is the executable code to generate Figure 3 in the paper.
